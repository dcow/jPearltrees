Pearltrees lets you organize\r\ncategorical data into trees and provides convenient methods\r\nfor further data curation.\r\n\r\nAs the owner of all the data in your Pearltrees account, you\r\ncan export your entire collection in an _RDF/XML_ format.\r\njPearltrees adapts the _RDF/XML_ structure back into the natural \r\ntree structure and provides methods for accessing the data\r\ncontainted within a *PearlTree*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\njPearltrees is still in development.  To use it right now, you\r\nneed (at least) the [Jena 2.7.2](http://jena.apache.org/download/index.html) \r\nlibraries on your classpath.  jPearltrees\r\nis backed by an Apache Jena RDF _Model_ class.  \r\n\r\nBeyond setup, usage is simple:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Construct a Pearltree..\r\nPearltree pt = Pearltrees.buildPearlTrees(\"pearltrees_export.rdf\")\r\n \r\n// Print a pretty version using a handler that follows \r\n// RefPearls recursively..\r\nPearltrees.traversePearlTree(pt, \r\n    Pearltrees.getTextPearlHandler(System.out, true));\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Default TextPearlHandler output:__\r\n<pre>\r\n# dcow's drop zone\r\n    # Education\r\n        # Evolving_Critique\r\n            * Science education myths that keep us from fixing the system\r\n            * Codecademy: Next Frontier In Digital Education Movement\r\n            * Public schools: Choose your own misadventure\r\n        @ Gamify Your Lessons\r\n        # GamificationofEdu\r\n            * How to teach history (and lots more) with Minecraft\r\n            * 3 Social Learning Trends to Watch in 2012 : Innovation\r\n            * Summit on Science, Entertainment, and Education - Will Wright on Vimeo\r\n        # MinorityandWomenEdu\r\n            * Study aims to learn why some black men succeed in college\r\n            * Female Geeks Flex Their Skills At Ladies-Only Hackathon\r\n            * Why women should pick science & math degrees over liberal arts\r\n        # SoftwareEdu\r\n            * Mentorship From Silicon Valley Techies Encourages High School Girls To Dream Bigger\r\n            * Computer Programming for All: A New Standard of Literacy\r\n            * How Codecademy got so hot, so fast\r\n            * Developer's Night | a tidal force\r\n            * Absolutely amazing: 6th grade iPhone app developer speaks at TEDx\r\n            * Apple's plan to get its products in schools?
