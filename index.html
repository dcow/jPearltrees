        <h1>jPearltrees Java Library</h1>

<p>Author: David Cowden</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>jPearltrees is a Java library that provides an interface for 
handling the <em>RDF/XML</em> data exported from a 
<a href="http://www.pearltrees.com">Pearltrees</a> account.</p>

<p><em>Pearltrees</em> is an individualy managed data-curation system with
support for teams and collaboration.  Pearltrees lets you organize
categorical data into trees and provides convenient methods
for further data curation.</p>

<p>As the owner of all the data in your Pearltrees account, you
can export your entire collection in an <em>RDF/XML</em> format.
jPearltrees adapts the <em>RDF/XML</em> structure back into the natural 
tree structure and provides methods for accessing the data
containted within a <em>PearlTree</em>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>jPearltrees is still in development.  To use it right now, you
need (at least) the <a href="http://jena.apache.org/download/index.html">Jena 2.7.2</a> 
libraries on your classpath.  jPearltrees
is backed by an Apache Jena RDF <em>Model</em> class.  </p>

<p>Beyond setup, usage is simple:</p>

<span class="n">Pearltree</span> <span class="n">pt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Pearltrees</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">buildPearlTrees</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"pearltrees_export.rdf"</span><span class="o">)</span>

<span class="c1">// Print a pretty version using a handler that follows </span>
